\title{Extract results from MCMC output.}
\description{
 This function extracts the Julia Object returned by \link{run_mcmc} to be usable within R.
 }
\usage{
extract_chains(mcmc)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mcmc}{Object output from \link{run_mcmc}.}
}
\value{
    \item{mu_chains}{List with M elements, each element a matrix of dimension iterations x D. mu_chains[[i]] is the MCMC samples for the mean vector of cluster i.}
    \item{Sigma_chains}{List with M elements, each element an array of dimension D x D x iterations. Sigma_chains[[i]] is the MCMC samples for the covariance matrix of cluster i.}
    \item{prop_chain}{Matrix of dimension M x iterations, containing the MCMC samples for the mixing proportions of each class.}
    \item{z_chain}{Matrix of dimension n x iterations, containing the MCMC samples for the class labels of each observation. These labels correspond to the row indices of the matrix of candidate latent classes.}
